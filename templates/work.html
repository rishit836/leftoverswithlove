    <p class="thanks">About LeftoversWithLove

        At LeftoversWithLove, we believe in the power of sharing a meal, in the warmth of a shared plate, and in the strength of a community that cares. Our story begins with a simple yet profound idea â€“ to bridge the gap between abundance and need, to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry, and to inspire a culture of compassion and sustainability.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Our Mission</b>
        <br>
        Inspired by the age-old Indian tradition of sharing food as an act of love and respect, we are on a mission to combat food wastage and hunger in our great nation. <br>
        We envision an India where surplus food from restaurants and gatherings finds its way to those who need it most. Through unity and empathy, we strive to nourish both bodies and souls.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>How It All Began</b>
        <br>
        The seeds of LeftoversWithLove were sown by a group of individuals who were deeply troubled by the paradox of food wastage coexisting with hunger in India.<br>
         This concern ignited a spark that soon turned into a nationwide movement. We started by connecting with restaurants, urging them to donate <br>
        surplus food instead of discarding it. The response was overwhelming, and it became evident that there was a collective desire to make a difference.
        <br><br><br>
        
        <b>Our Approach</b>
        <br>
        LeftoversWithLove is not just an organization; it's a community. It's a place where individuals, restaurants, and volunteers come together to make a tangible impact. Through our user-friendly platform, restaurants can easily notify us about excess food, and individuals can share their surplus meals from parties and gatherings. Our dedicated volunteers ensure that this food reaches those who need it most, bringing smiles to countless faces.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Transparency and Impact</b>
        <br>
        We take pride in our commitment to transparency. Real-time updates on our platform keep you informed about the number of meals rescued and the lives touched. Your contributions, whether in the form of surplus food, time, or financial support, have a direct and measurable impact on the lives of fellow Indians.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Join Us in Making a Difference</b>
        <br>
        LeftoversWithLove is not just about reducing food wastage; it's about creating a brighter, more compassionate India.<br>
         We invite you to be a part of this journey. Whether you're a restaurant owner, an individual with a surplus of love to share, <br>
        or someone looking to volunteer, your participation makes a world of difference. Together, we can turn a simple act of sharing into a powerful force for change.
